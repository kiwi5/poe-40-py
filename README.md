# poe-40-py

"Just take these numbers and return best combinations summing up to 40".

This is for the purpose of finding an effective way to combine looted items, needed for ()[Quality Recipe] in Path of Exile game.
Saves the time, as counting it in calculator (or mentally, as some are able to) is no longer needed.

Only after running this script have I gotten to know HOW MANY more combinations there could be, that I hadn't suspected.


How to use:
 1. Open the script.
 2. Write procent values, separated with spaces, of all items of a given type you'd like to vendor. Press Enter.
 3. Any (such,enclosed) values make up a single 40% recipe.

It needs Python 3 installed on your machine to work. Python 2 shouldn't work.
Tested it on 3.6.2 only.


This is what I consider my very first program, even though this isn't strictly true.
