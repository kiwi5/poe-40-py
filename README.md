# PoE 40

### "Just take these numbers between 1 & 19, and return best combinations summing up to 40".

This is for the purpose of finding an effective way to combine looted items, needed for [Quality Recipe](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Vendor_recipe_system#Quality_Items) in Path of Exile game.
Saves the time, as counting it in calculator (or mentally, as some are able to) is no longer needed.


### How to use:
 1. Open the script.
 1. Write percent values of all items of a given type you'd like to vendor.
 1. Script outputs what combinations are available to you.


#### NOTE: It needs Python 3 installed on your machine to work. Python 2 shouldn't work.
#### Tested on 3.6.2 only.

Only after running this script have I gotten to know _how many_ more combinations there could be, that I hadn't even suspected.


Made for the purpose of learning and automation. 
Maybe someone else will find it useful, too, but I expect there to be better solutions for this already.

This is what I consider my very first complete program, although there have been a few tiny ones before.
